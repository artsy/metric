## Summary

Metric is a thin HTTP wrapper for [node-dogstatsd](https://github.com/mrbar42/node-dogstatsd). It receives metric data from browser applications and forwards it to a Datadog Agent, which in turn handles collection of metrics from multiple sources into Datadog.

## Development

### Datadog local setup

* Install the [Datadog Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/) locally.
* Enter the management interface.
* Set up the API key.
* To avoid publishing your computer's system metrics, disable all the local checks.

### Running locally

Development is done via [Hokusai](https://github.com/artsy/hokusai) (follow the setup instructions in that readme). Then you may run the following command:

```sh
hokusai dev start
```

That will build a Docker container with the app's dependencies. You can also run development outside Docker, via `yarn install` and `yarn start` (run `npm install -g yarn`, if you don't already have Yarn).

## Usage

### Whitelists

Because Datadog plans have an allotment of custom metrics and tags, Metric offers the ability to restrict possible values for metric names and tags that are allowed. The whitelists are managed by environment variables.

* Get the current METRIC_NAME_WHITELIST with `hokusai staging env get METRIC_NAME_WHITELIST`
* Set its new value with `hokusai staging env set METRIC_NAME_WHITELIST=preexisting-tag:value,new-tag:new-value`
* Refresh the environment with `hokusai staging deployment refresh`
* Do the same thing in `production` when you're satisfied.

### Global tags

The Datadog Agent is already configured to send an `env` tag with all metrics it publishes. If you want to add additional global tags, set the `GLOBAL_TAGS` environment variable to a comma-separated list of tags with the process mentioned in the previous section.

### Publishing metrics

From a client application, make a POST request to the `/report` endpoint. Example:

```javascript
// TODO
```

You may push multiple metrics in one payload. In all situations, Metric will respond with status code 202 and the text "OK", so watch Datadog for metrics appearing and [Metric's logs]() for errors.

The following payload demonstrates the format of all possible metric types:

```javascript
{
  "serviceName": "client-service",
  "metrics": [
    {
      "type": "timer",
      "name": "elapsed-time",  
      "value": 12345,
      "tags": ["tag-name:tag-arg"]
    },
    {
      "type": "increment",
      "name": "count",  
      "sampleRate": 1, // optional; defaults to 1
      "tags": ["tag-name:tag-arg"]
    },
    {
      "type": "incrementBy",
      "name": "count",  
      "value": 5,
      "tags": ["tag-name:tag-arg"]
    },
    {
      "type": "decrement",
      "name": "count",  
      "sampleRate": 3, // optional; defaults to 1
      "tags": ["tag-name:tag-arg"]
    },
    {
      "type": "decrementBy",
      "name": "count",  
      "value": 3,
      "tags": ["tag-name:tag-arg"]
    },
    {
      "type": "gauge",
      "name": "stat",  
      "sampleRate": 2,  // optional; defaults to 1
      "value": 12345,
      "tags": ["tag-name:tag-arg"]
    },
    {
      "type": "histogram",
      "name": "stat",  
      "value": 4567,
      "sampleRate": 6,
      "tags": ["tag-name:tag-arg"]
    },
    {
      "type": "set",
      "name": "tracked-items",  
      "value": "item",
      "tags": ["tag-name:tag-arg"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Name

A volley in sports is to knock an airborne ball onward without letting it touch the ground. Or it's a large number of projectiles airborn at once. Either way, it's a vaguely physics-oriented term, because of...motion...and stuff.
